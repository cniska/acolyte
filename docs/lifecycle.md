# Lifecycle

Lifecycle executes one request through a bounded phase loop:

```text
resolve → prepare → generate → evaluate → finalize
```

## Phase contracts

- **resolve**: pick mode and policy from request intent
- **prepare**: build base agent input, tools, session context, and policy state
- **generate**: run model + tool loop for one attempt; the model may also emit a lifecycle signal (`done`, `no_op`, `blocked`) alongside its final text
- **evaluate**: accept a valid lifecycle signal or apply evaluators and choose `done` or bounded regeneration
- **finalize**: emit final response and lifecycle summary events; a `blocked` signal maps to `ChatResponseState = "awaiting-input"`, signaling the TUI to show a waiting indicator until the user replies

## Regeneration model

- evaluators can request regeneration
- regeneration uses task-scoped `lifecycleState` to carry internal feedback and verify outcome between attempts
- generation input is rebuilt from immutable base input plus pending mode-scoped lifecycle feedback
- selected guard blocks may also be translated into lifecycle feedback before the next attempt
- a valid lifecycle signal can end the loop cleanly before recovery logic reopens the turn
- regeneration is bounded by lifecycle policy caps
- yield checks only occur at safe checkpoints between lifecycle decisions

## Lifecycle state

- `lifecycleState` is internal, task-scoped runtime state owned by the lifecycle
- it currently carries:
  - `feedback`: pending runtime feedback consumed by the next matching-mode attempt
  - `verifyOutcome`: structured verifier result used across `keepResult` restore boundaries
  - `repeatedFailure`: task-scoped failure streak state used to surface one recovery nudge per repeated failure signature
- lifecycle may also accept a task-scoped lifecycle signal from generation when current runtime state has no contradiction
- lifecycle may translate selected guard blocks into feedback, so the next attempt can recover with clearer runtime context
- `lifecycleState` is not persisted to session history or memory sources
- `lifecycleState` supports the model with concrete runtime outcomes; it does not plan tasks or decide how issues should be resolved

## Memory integration point

- memory injection happens during request setup before generation
- memory commit is scheduled as best-effort background work at finalize
- commit failures are logged via lifecycle debug events and do not fail the user response

## Tool recovery

- `ToolRecovery` is a tool-owned contract for stable failure recovery
- lifecycle consumes it generically; it does not hardcode tool-specific retry policy
- recovery may include optional next-step hints like a suggested next tool or target paths when the tool can state them concretely
- recovery may also declare which successful follow-up tool result resolves the failure, so lifecycle can clear it without tool-specific heuristics
